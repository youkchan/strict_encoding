//! Library implementing **strict encoding** standard, defined by
//! [LNPBP-7](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/blob/master/lnpbp-0007.md).
//! Strict encoding is a binary conservative encoding extensively used in
//! client-side-validation for deterministic portable (platform-independent)
//! serialization of data with a known internal data structure. Strict encoding
//! is a schema-less encoding.
//!
//! As a part of strict encoding, crate also includes implementation of
//! network address **uniform encoding** standard
//! ([LMPBP-42]([LNPBP-7](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/blob/master/lnpbp-0042.md))),
//! which allows representation of any kind of network address as a fixed-size
//! byte string occupying 37 bytes. This standard is used for the strict
//! encoding of networking addresses.
//!
//! Library defines two main traits, [`StrictEncode`] and [`StrictDecode`],
//! which should be implemented on each type that requires to be represented
//! for client-side-validation. It also defines possible encoding error cases
//! with [`Error`] and provides derivation macros
//! `#[derive(StrictEncode, StrictDecode)]`, which are a part of
//! `strict_encode_derive` sub-crate and represented by a default feature
//! `derive`. Finally, it implements strict encoding traits for main data types
//! defined by rust standard library and frequently used crates; the latter
//! increases the number of dependencies and thus can be controlled with
//! feature flags:
//! - `chrono` (used by default): date & time types from `chrono` crate
//! - `miniscript`: types defined in bitcoin Miniscript
//! - `crypto`: non-bitcoin cryptographic primitives, which include Ed25519
//!   curve, X25519 signatures from `ed25519-dalek` library and pedersen
//!   commitments + bulletproofs from `grin_secp256k1zkp` library. Encodings for
//!   other cryptography-related types, such as Secp256k1 and hashes, are always
//!   included as a part of the library - see NB below.
//!
//! NB: this crate requires `bitcoin` as an upstream dependency since many of
//!     strict-encoded formats are standardized as using *bitcoin consensus
//!     encoding*.
